# What is Prolog:
# 1. Prolog stands for "Programming in Logic."
# 2. It's a declarative programming language, meaning you describe the problem to be solved rather than specifying the steps to solve it.
# 3. Prolog programs consist of facts and rules that define relationships between objects and conditions.

#Facts
likes(ram, mango).
girl(seema).
likes(bill, cindy).
color(rose, red).
owns(john, gold).

# Explanation:
# - `likes(ram, mango)`: This fact states that Ram likes mango.
# - `girl(seema)`: This fact indicates that Seema is a girl.
# - `likes(bill, cindy)`: This fact expresses that Bill likes Cindy.
# - `color(rose, red)`: This fact specifies that Rose is red.
# - `owns(john, gold)`: This fact states that John owns gold.

# In Prolog, facts are represented with simple syntax. They start with lowercase letters and end with periods. The items or relations between items are enclosed in parentheses. These facts can then be queried using Prolog to determine their truth or falsity.
